# Rotating Cube

Creating a rotating cube on the command line using python!

#### ISSUES:
    - Current grid is has too low a resolution, need to figure out a way of having a resolution such that non integer values can be plotted
    - Fix: increase the number of points that make up the grid, so that the axes now go up in a .5 instead, see if this helps, if so then you can round to the nearest 0.5 instad.
